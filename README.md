* 🚀 **Advanced Challenge:** Write a simple container runtime in Go, without using the Docker daemon, to understand the underlying syscalls.

### Day 0: The Architect's View

* **Session:** A comprehensive walkthrough of the final system architecture. We'll cover the flow of requests, the role of each component (service mesh, CI/CD, observability), and the key design decisions. You'll always know how your daily work fits into the bigger picture.

### Phase 1: Foundation (Days 1-15)

#### Section 1.1: Containerization Mastery (Days 1-5)

* **Day 1-4: Docker Deep Dive, Networking, Storage, Security**

    * 🎓 **Beginner:** A container fails to start. Debug the `docker logs` to find the incorrect database connection string passed as an environment variable.
    * 🧑‍💻 **Practitioner:** Your multi-container application has a networking issue. One service cannot resolve another's DNS name. Find and fix the misconfigured Docker network.
    * 🚀 **Advanced:** A container works on your machine but not on the build server. Diagnose a subtle file permission issue between the host bind mount and the container's non-root user.

#### Section 1.2: Kubernetes Architecture (Days 6-10)

    * 🚀 **Advanced Track:** Implement the "Operator Pattern". Build a basic Custom Resource Definition (CRD) and a simple controller in Go or Python to manage the deployment and lifecycle of the e-commerce application declaratively.
* **Day 15: Break-It-Friday**
    * 🎓 **Beginner:** The frontend pod is in `CrashLoopBackOff`. Debug the logs to find it's crashing because the backend API service isn't available yet. Implement a startup probe to fix it.
